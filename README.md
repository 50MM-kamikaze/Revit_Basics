Just a start of Revit learning Journey
1. My first learning stage in Revit was to learn drawing grids and levels accourding to the given specifications of the project and site.
   - Image-1 shows different Levels required for the project:

3. Secondly, A DWG file needed to be linked with auto - origin to origin positioning, then make grids specified on the DWG file.
   - Image-3 shows linked DWG file in the "L1-high" structural plane:
